    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>20 peeled garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Â¾teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1cup dry chardonnay</li>
        <li>Steamed white rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven over medium-high, add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt on both sides, then add to the pot skin side down.</li>
        <li>Cook until the skin turns golden and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip, and sear the other side briefly, about 1 minute. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li> 
            Add the garlic to the schmaltzy oil over medium-high, 
            and stir until fragrant and very lightly golden at the edges, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the white pepper, then immediately add the wine and 1 cup water.</li>
        <li>Scrape up any stuck-on bits from the bottom of the pot while bringing the liquid to a simmer.</li>
        <li>
            Nestle the chicken in the pot skin side up, cover and cook in the oven until the chicken and garlic are meltingly tender, 
            and the wine has reduced, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed. Serve with rice.</li>
    </ol>

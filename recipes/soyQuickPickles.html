    <h1>Soy Quick Pickles</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My hyper-fixation snack.</p>
    <p>I almost always have a jar of these in the fridge, but they never last more than a day or two.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound japanese or persion cucumbers</li>
        <li>1 large clove garlic, grated</li>
        <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vinegar, I like 1 apple cider + 1 rice wine personally</li>
        <li>Pinch of sugar</li>
        <li>Splash of toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Thickly slice cucumbers and place in a colander. Make nice bite size pieces.</li>
        <li>Heavily salt cucumbers and toss to coat. Set aside to draw out moisture.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile mix all other ingredients in a large jar.</li>
        <li>After a lot of moisture has drawn out of the cucumbers, or as long as you can wait, drain and rinse.</li>
        <li>Place the cucumbers in the jar with your brine and tip to ensure everything is coated.</li>
        <li>Place in fridge, turning jar over periodically to ensure that all cucumbers pickle.</li>
        <li>
            Enjoy as a garnish on any rice or noodle bowl. 
            Or just eat straight out of the fridge standing in the kitchen like I do.
        </li>
    </ol>
